                    http-db aims to provide simple interface for reading and writing various resources on http protocol.

                    <h2>How this works</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every unique URLs are like a file - you can save some content to a specific URL.
                        And when <code>GET</code> request is made on that URL, you get the content back.
                        To save, you make <code>POST/PUT</code> request to it, with body containing the content
                        you'd like to save. Be it html, json, image, or whatever content type it supports.
                        (currently it only supports <code>text/*</code> MIME types)
                    </p>

                    <section>
                        <h3>Authentication</h3>
                        <p>
                            In order to use the http-db, majority of operations require authentication via 
                            <code>Authorization</code> header in the request.

                            However, you can request certain URLs to be publicly accessible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <small>
                                    (Getting a token needs manual operation from Kyu.)
                            </small>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Add the following header to the request.
                        </p>

                        <div style="margin: 2em 0;">
                            <code style="margin:2em;">Authorization: Token [Your token]</code>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Writing resource</h3>
                        <p>
                            Writing data can be done via either <code>POST, PUT</code> request. <code>POST</code>
                            request will attempt to create the resource. If the resource identified by URL exists
                            already, it'll fail.
                        </p>

                        <div style="margin: 2em 0;">
                            <pre style="margin:2em;">
&gt; POST /hello HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: username.http-db.com
&gt; Authorization: Token [your-authtoken]
&gt; Content-Type: text/html

hello world!
                            </pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The above call will create a new resource, at path <code>/hello</code>, with
                            content <code>hello world!</code>, as <code>text/html</code> content type.

                            So when you make a <code>GET</code> request to <code>https://username.http-db.com/hello</code>,
                            You'll get a response body with <code>hello world!</code>, as <code>html</code>.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Options via query params</h4>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <code>make_public=true</code> - Making a new resource created with <code>POST</code> request
                                will make <code>GET</code> request to succeed without <code>Authorization</code> header, making
                                the resource publicly available without any authentication.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            <code>PUT</code> works the same way, however, it will not check for existence
                            of the resource, it'll simply override it. And create the resource if it doesn't exist.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Reading resource</h3>
                        <p>
                            Reading data is a simple <code>GET</code> request, at the URL that you know exists.
                            As you've expected, if the resource does not exist, it'll return <code>404</code>
                            response.

                            Remember, that by default, all requests must be made with <code>Authorization</code>
                            header. Only by setting the specific resource public, the request will succeed without
                            <code>Authorization</code> header.
                        </p>

                        <div style="margin: 2em 0;">
                            <pre style="margin:2em;">
&gt; GET /hello HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: username.http-db.com
&gt; Authorization: Token [authtoken]                                        
                            </pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The request above will be responded with something like the following.
                        </p>

                        <div style="margin: 2em 0;">

                            Again, as you might have expected, deleting a resource is done via <code>DELETE</code> request.
                            Make a request to the URL of the resource to remove it.
                        </p>
